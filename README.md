Soccer Formation Application

https://github.com/loneyb11/Team-Selector-Project-3

An application that displays teams in their formation that can be adjusted and shared via screen shot, pdf and/or stored in memory.

User story - A soccer needs to visual see the players available to him/her and assign them a position for a particular game.  Coach could share this with his players or parents (at the youth level).

Alternatively the coach cannot make this particular game as it clashes with another team that they coach.  The coach that is covering the game needs to know how to set the payers up as they are less familiar with the team.  Head coach logins into their application selects the the team from from an array of other teams in the club.  They organize their players based on availability, position them on the field and make adjustments using a draggable CSS/JQuery feature.  Coach then emails, texts, or even saves over the saver so that the covering coach has access to the team.
